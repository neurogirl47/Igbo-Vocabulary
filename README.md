# Igbo-Vocabulary
My collection of Igbo vocabulary. Mostly json files where I try to organize information about the Igbo language

[] @TODO: Include metadata in suffixes.json about each word like--> root, suffix, and other descriptors

[x] @TODO: make each suffix in suffixes.json it's own object

[] @TODO: There words without definitions in suffixes.json

[] @TODO: Use numbers as metadata as well as Igbo definitions (not english words) in suffixes.json

[] @TODO: Add ntupo & udaolu to all entries in suffixes.json where applicable
